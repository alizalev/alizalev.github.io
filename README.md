## Hello World

My name is Aliza Lev and I am a student at Lehigh University. I am  majoring in journalism and minoring in marketing and graphic design. I am using GitHub as a part of my data journalism class. This will be a place to host my data journalism projects throughout the semester.

## Where Do Lehigh Students Come From?
This infographic displays the percentage of Lehigh students that come from Pennsylvania, New York/New Jersey, other states or another country. This data came from a Lehigh University Office of Institutional Reseach and Strategic Analytics Fall 2020 University Profile. This data shows that the majority of Lehigh students come from New York or New Jersey.

## Is Greek Life "Big" At Lehigh University?
This infographic shows Lehigh Undergraduate Fraternity & Sorority Enrollment Trends for the Spring of 2021. This data came from a Lehigh University Office of Fraternity & Sorority Affairs Trend Analysis Report, which included enrollment data by semester from 2017-2021. I used this data to answer the question, "Is Greek life 'big' at Lehigh University?" This question could be relevant to incoming Lehigh students, current first-year students or students who are not in Greek life. I recently learned that most people outside of Greek life at Lehigh actually know very little about how Greek life operates and how large its presence is at Lehigh. Based on the data I found, I was able to conclude that for a small school like Lehigh, a significant percentage of students are involved in Greek life. I was also interested to discover that there are more females involved in Greek life, despite there being more fraternities than sororities on campus.

## Lehigh Undergraduate Enrollment by Sex Across 10 years

This time series chart shows the percentage of male and female undergraduates at Lehigh from 2011 to 2020. Based on this chart, we can see that there has consistently been more men than women at Lehigh, though the percentages have fluctated over the years. In 2017, Lehigh was the closest it has ever been to an equal distribution among the sexes with 51.5% males and 48.5% females making up the undergraduate population that year. This information is relevant to prospective Lehigh students. A lot of high school students pay close attention to the gender breakdown of colleges, as some students prefer to attend a school with more men or more women. This data shows prospective Lehigh students that while there are more men than women at Lehigh, the numbers are still pretty close and tend to fluctuate often.

## Top 10 U.S. College Towns 2019

This map shows the top 10 U.S. college towns in 2019. These cities and towns were ranked by 24/7 Wall St. and reported by USA Today. This ranking was determined using data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, which looked at the share of residents enrolled in a graduate or undergraduate institution. It was discovered that towns with large amounts of student residents shows how colleges and universities can influence a town. The majority of the towns that were ranked are home to large universities, which explains why such a large portion of their populations are enrolled in college and the average age of their residents are lower than the national average. I think this information is primarily relevant not to college students or future college student, but families looking for a place to live. College towns typically have well-educated populations that are young, diverse and affordable. This makes them ideal spots to live permanently.

## Party Location Preferences at Lehigh Based on Gender and On-Campus Group Involvement

These two data visualizations show Lehigh students' party location preferences based on their gender and what groups they are involved in on campus. This data came from a survey conducted among over 500 Lehigh students. See the original survey responses [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M3fvI1f7l4QP_zvlo5YA405N-6oZXp8SA1btxvsUyeI/edit?usp=sharing). [Here](https://coursesite.lehigh.edu/pluginfile.php/4779926/course/section/3440491/Lehigh%20Party%20Scene%20Survey.pdf) is a link to the survey itself. The party locations listed are fraternity houses on the hill, off-campus houses or neither. The on-campus groups looked at are Greek fraternities and sororities, and varsity athletic teams. These data visualizations are interactive, so you can check the boxes to view the location preferences for any gender(s) or campus group(s) that are listed.

In my visualization that looks at location preference by gender, we can see that the majority of females (27.99%) prefer off-campus houses for parties, while the majority of males (22.97%) prefer fraternity houses. I chose to exclude the data from those who do not identify as male or female and those who preferred to not list their gender because there was limited data in those categories. 

My second visualization looks at location preference by what groups the surveyed population is involved in. Based on this visualization, we can see that the majority of students involved in a Greek fraternity and sorority (26.71%) prefer attending parties in a fraternity house on the hill. Additionally, the majority of students who are on a varsity athletic team (12.87%) prefer attending parties in an off-campus house. The majority of students who are involved in neither of these groups (12.87%) also prefer to attend parties in off-campus houses. I chose to exclude the data from those who are involved in both a Greek fraternity or sorority and a varsity athletic team because there was limited data in that category.

I think all of the data presented in these visualizations makes a lot of sense in the context of Lehigh’s social scene. Those who are not involved in a Greek organization are likely to prefer attending a party in an off-campus house because fraternity and sorority houses are way up on the hill, far away from the off-campus areas that most non-Greek Lehigh students live in. Additionally, it makes sense that Greek males prefer to attend parties on the hill, because at Lehigh only fraternities, not sororities, can host Greek registered parties. So, parties on the hill are only located in fraternity houses. These houses on the hill are equipped with large, designated party rooms for entertaining guests that are located away from the kitchen, bedrooms, etc. When a fraternity hosts a party in an off-campus house, there is less space and it is more difficult to keep guests contained. Therefore, based on my prior knowledge, it makes sense that most males prefer to attend parties in fraternity houses. I think this data and the information that can come from it is important to the Lehigh community. It seems to me that holding parties on the hill is only favorable for members of the Greek community, specifically Greek males. Parties on the hill are not as accessible to other members of the Lehigh community, leading them to prefer attending off-campus parties. The hill, as it is only occupied by Lehigh students, is a much safer environment for hosting parties. Recently, there have been many concerning incidents off-campus that have occurred late at night, making off-campus parties a risk, especially for those who have consumed alcohol. Though parties on the hill are in a safer and more controlled environment, they are not as accessible for those not involved in Greek life, creating safety issues for the non-Greek community and furthering the existing divide between “Greeks and non-Greeks” on Lehigh’s campus.

## Where It Pays to Go To College

Continuing with my theme of investigating college-related data, I took a look at three datasets that focused on post-graduation salaries for college students based on the type of school, regions and individual majors. Each of the three datasets showed the starting median salary, mid-career median salary, mid-career 10th percentile salary, mid-career 25th percentile salary, mid-career 75th percentile salary and mid-career 90th percentile salary for its given criteria. I chose to only analyze only the average mid-career median salary for each dataset in order to give a broader, more comprehensive overview.

See the source of my data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries/version/1?select=salaries-by-college-type.csv). See my visualizations on Tableau public [here](https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries/version/1?select=salaries-by-college-type.csv). My visualization is better displayed on that link than here on Github.
